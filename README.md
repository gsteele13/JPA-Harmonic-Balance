# JPA-Harmonic-Balance
A repository to explore implementing the Harmonic Balance method for calculating JPA saturation. 

## Jupytext

To be able to collaborate effectively using jupyter notebooks and GIT, we will use Jupytext and paired markdown files:

https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Make sure to have it installed before you start editing files. 

For convenience, we can leave the ipynb files in the repo too: if you end up with a conflict, you can always delete the `.ipynb` file and regenerate it by opening the `.md` paired copy.
